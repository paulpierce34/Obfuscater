# Obfuscater
This tool is used to obfuscate your powershell scripts by chopping into separate arrays, assigning to random variables, and then re-combining at the end for execution. Not fully ready or tested yet. Any and all testing currently done has been on one-liners, and this obfuscation technique seems to work for them

** NOTE **:  Any get-childitem paths with spaces you provide, need to be wrapped in **double quotes**
